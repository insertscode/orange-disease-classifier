# Orange Disease Classifier App

This is the frontend and backend code for an android app that classifies different orange fruit diseases. A machine learning model on GCP is triggered when a user uploads an image from the app. Images uploaded by users get sent to a machine learning model deployed on GCP that evaluates the image and responds with a prediction. 

The ML currently attepts to classify
- Alternaria
- Anthracnose
- Black spot
- Citrus Canker
- Citrus Greening
- Melanose
- Citrus scab 

from healthy oranges.

## Some data issues to be dealt with in the future
1. Create a new dataset because I managed to delete the one I created for this project before I made a backup -_____-
   - Once this is done, I will make a new model and record it's performance metrics.
