# Orange Disease Classifier App

I created this project to showcase some of my skills by creating a ML powered android application. Here you'll find the frontend and backend code for the orange fruit disease classifier app. The machine learning model is deployed to GCP and accessed from the app when a user uploads an image to be classified. After future data cleaning, gathering, and manipulation I will retrain the model and store it's results somewhere in the repo. 

The model deployed on GCP classifies
- Alternaria
- Anthracnose
- Black spot
- Citrus Canker
- Citrus Greening
- Melanose
- Citrus scab 

from healthy oranges with an accurracy of 90%. 

## Data sources
Will be disclosed in the near future.


## Link to android app

## IOS App status
Not coming soon. Too expensive for just one app at the moment. 


## Some data issues to be dealt with in the future
1. Class imbalance
2. Wrongfully labelled instances
3. Too little data
